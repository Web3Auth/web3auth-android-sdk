## üåü Configuration

To get started, open a sample scene `Web3AuthSample` inside `Assets/Plugins/Web3AuthSDK/Samples/Web3AuthSample.scene`

Before building the application for Android/IOS you need to register the redirect_uri which can be done easily by the tool provided inside the SDK. To achieve that, you need to follow the steps mentioned below.

- Open deep link generator tool provided by Web3Auth Unity SDK from "Window > Web3Auth > Deep Link Generator"
  ![Deep Link Generator](./Images/Deep%20Link%20Generator.png)
- Enter the redirect_url _(i-e torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth)_ and click generate.
  > To use your own client_id , register your app on [https://web3auth.io/](https://web3auth.io/) and replace the client_id inside `Assets/Plugins/Web3AuthSDK/Samples/Web3AuthSample.cs` script.

### Configure an Web3Auth project

Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), create or select an Web3Auth project:

- Add {{SCHEMA}}://{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}://auth to Whitelist URLs.
  _i-e torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth_
- Copy the Project ID for later usage as client_id

## üí• Initialization & Usage

In your sign-in script', create an Web3Auth instance with your Web3Auth project's configurations and configure it like this:

```csharp
Web3Auth web3Auth = new Web3Auth(new Web3AuthOptions() {
  redirectUrl = new Uri("torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth"),
    clientId = "BAwFgL-r7wzQKmtcdiz2uHJKNZdK7gzEf2q-m55xfzSZOw8jLOyIi4AVvvzaEQO5nv2dFLEmf9LBkF8kaq3aErg",
    network = Web3Auth.Network.TESTNET,
    whiteLabel = new WhiteLabelData() {
      name = "Web3Auth Sample App",
        logoLight = null,
        logoDark = null,
        defaultLanguage = "en",
        dark = true,
        theme = new Dictionary < string, string > {
          {
            "primary",
            "#123456"
          }
        }
    }
});
web3Auth.onLogin += onLogin;
web3Auth.onLogout += onLogout;
private void onLogin(Web3AuthResponse response) {
    // Handle user signing in
}
private void onLogout() {
  // Handle user signing out
}
```

### Simulate redirect callback inside Unity Editor

Web3Auth Unity SDK provides a tool to simulate the redirect callback. To open go to _"Window > Web3Auth > Debug Deep Link"_ and paste the redirect uri (it must include the response code)
